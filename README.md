# Evolve Workout Tracker

> **Get more out of your workouts**

Evolve is a workout tracking app designed for iOS devices. Seamlessly log your workouts in real time by adding exercises, sets, weights, and difficulty (RPE). Track your progress over time and gain valuable insights into your performance, including total volume by exercise and estimated one-rep maxes.

You can create and save custom workout templates to quickly jump into your favorite routinesâ€”or explore sample templates for fresh inspiration. With an extensive library of over 250 exercises, complete with video demos and step-by-step instructions, youâ€™ll never run out of workout ideas.

Additional features include a built-in rest timer, the ability to track body measurements, add exercise notes, create your own exercises, and more.

## Why I Built This

Iâ€™ve been passionate about weightlifting and bodybuilding for over 10 years. During that time, I experimented with various methods of workout trackingâ€”from mental notes to pen-and-paper logs to basic notes apps.

My growing interest in web and software development sparked the idea to create my own mobile app, one that optimizes workout tracking and drives better results. **Evolve** is the culmination of my experiences in bodybuilding and programming, serving as both a tool to enhance my workouts and a hands-on project to learn the ins and outs of app development, including deploying my first mobile app to production.
